<h1>Recipe Book</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Recipebook allows user to look up recipes. These recipes can searched on the basis of Igredients such as Potato, or duration it takes to cook them. It also allows users to put their pantry in app. The idea is that if they run out of an ingredient they can remove it from pantry and add it to the shopping list. Recipebook also allows user to make a grocery list assigned to a particular date. Different dates can have different lists. It stores the data when the app is closed, so when opened again everything will be as left.
